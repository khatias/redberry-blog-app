### What I learned

What I Learned
In the course of this project, I acquired valuable skills and experiences:

- Fetch API Implementation: Explored and applied the Fetch API, enhancing my ability to communicate with the backend, retrieve data, and handle responses effectively.

- Backend Interaction: Successfully incorporated backend data retrieval into the project, marking a significant milestone in my journey as a developer.

 - Organized Development: Adopted a more structured and organized approach to development, emphasizing meticulous planning and task execution. This enhanced workflow allowed for a smoother development process and improved project outcomes.

These learning experiences not only contributed to the successful completion of the project but also broadened my skill set and reinforced the importance of systematic development practices.

### Continued development

 I'm focusing on:

Improving Fetch Skills: Enhancing data retrieval using Fetch for smoother backend interactions.

Backend Collaboration: Strengthening communication with the backend for more dynamic projects.

Refining Organization: Continuing to prioritize a structured workflow for clear and maintainable code.

Advancing User Experience: Exploring further enhancements, potentially beyond tabs, for a user-friendly interface.
